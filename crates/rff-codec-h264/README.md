The **H.264 / AVC** video codec adapter for **remade_ffmpeg_rs**, backed by
[`rusty_h264`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_h264) — pure Rust with vendored
hand-written assembly, no C. Registers `h264` for both decode and encode.

- **Pure Rust, no C/FFI** — the SIMD is vendored assembly assembled by `nasm`, not a C library.
- **Default build needs `nasm`** on your `PATH` for the `h264-asm` feature. Use `--no-default-features` for the pure-Rust scalar path instead.
- **Patent note:** H.264/AVC is patent-relevant. No patent licence is granted or implied; royalties are the responsibility of whoever distributes or commercially deploys a product incorporating it. See the [patents section](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust/remade_ffmpeg_rs#patents).
- A C/FFI alternative (Cisco openh264) exists in-tree as `rff-codec-openh264` but is **deliberately unpublished** and off by default — this crate is the pure-Rust path.

## Usage

```rust
use rff_codec::CodecRegistry;
use rff_core::{CodecId, Error};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut codecs = CodecRegistry::new();
    rff_codec_h264::register(&mut codecs);

    // Now reachable by id or by FFmpeg-style name.
    let _decoder = codecs.find_decoder(CodecId::H264)?;
    let codec = codecs.by_id(CodecId::H264).expect("just registered");
    println!("{} — decode: {}, encode: {}", codec.long_name, codec.can_decode(), codec.can_encode());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Part of Remade With Rust

This crate is one layer of
**[remade_ffmpeg_rs](https://github.com/Remade-With-Rust/remade_ffmpeg_rs)** — a
ground-up, permissively-licensed Rust rebuild of FFmpeg: a drop-in
`ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` CLI on pure-Rust codecs, with no copyleft. Most users want
the [`remade-ffmpeg`](https://crates.io/crates/remade-ffmpeg) engine facade or the
[`rff-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/rff-cli) binaries rather than this crate
directly.
