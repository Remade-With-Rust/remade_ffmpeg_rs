# `unsafe` in rusty_mp3

**Last audited**: 2026-10-04 (use-protection-please, H-16). **Policy**: `unsafe` exists
only for explicit SIMD intrinsics. No FFI, no raw allocation, no `transmute`, no
`static mut`, no manual `Send`/`Sync`. Every `unsafe` block carries a `// SAFETY:`
comment naming its bounds argument; every `unsafe fn` carries a `# Safety` section.

## The one class: SIMD kernels

Each kernel is a twin of a safe scalar function that stays in the tree as its
**oracle** (`*_simd_matches_scalar` tests, `assert_eq!` — the twins are
bit-identical by construction: output index = lane, original accumulation order,
separate mul + add, never FMA). The scalar twin is also the fallback on every CPU
without the ISA, and is forced for A/B with `MP3_ISA=scalar`.

The two obligations, and how each is discharged:

1. **The ISA is present.** `isa::use_simd()` / `simd_available()` decide once
   (AVX by runtime detection on x86_64; NEON is baseline on AArch64; scalar
   elsewhere). Every call into an AVX function is behind that flag, and the
   shipping paths enter one `#[target_feature(enable = "avx")]` function per
   granule (`hybrid_avx`, `polyphase_avx`) so the kernels inline inside it.
2. **Every access is in bounds.** All operands are **fixed-size arrays** whose
   lengths are part of the type, and every pointer offset is a function of loop
   counters and constant table dimensions — never of stream data. The two kernels
   that take a ring-buffer position (`window_*`, `fold_*`) mask it themselves
   (`head & !63`, `head & !31`), so their bounds hold for any argument; the
   quantizer kernels' loads are capped by `i + width <= hi <= 576` whatever the
   band table holds.

`src/lab/` (the opt-in `lab` feature) mentions `unsafe` only in documentation.

## Verification

- Oracle tests run on x86_64 natively and on AArch64 under qemu
  (`tools/bench/arm_qemu_test.sh`); poisoning a NEON twin with a fused
  `vfmaq` fails all three decode oracles.
- Miri: the library's test suite under `cargo +nightly miri test --lib`
  (Miri reports no SIMD on its target, so it exercises the scalar twins and all
  safe code; the intrinsic kernels are covered by the oracle tests and the
  bounds argument above).
- Byte identity of the whole pipeline across arms: 720/720 decode hashes,
  `MP3_ISA=scalar` vs default (docs: `docs/plans/mp3-kernel-ledger.md`).

## Changing this file

Adding an `unsafe` block requires: a scalar oracle and a `*_matches_scalar` test, a
`// SAFETY:` comment with the bounds argument, a row above, and a bump of the
audit date. The crate's unsafe count must not grow without that (H-11).
