//! Short-block coding (brick **Q5**) — the forward reorder and the short-block
//! quantizer.
//!
//! Short blocks give the filterbank finer time resolution, which suppresses the
//! pre-echo a long block smears before a transient. The forward MDCT (`mdct.rs`)
//! already produces the three short windows interleaved in *subband* order; the
//! bitstream stores them in *scalefactor-band* order (sfb-major, then window, then
//! frequency). [`reorder_subband_to_bitstream`] is the exact inverse of the
//! decoder's requantize reorder, so a coded short block round-trips.
//!
//! This first version quantises uniformly (flat per-window scalefactors,
//! `subblock_gain = 0`) under global-gain rate control — valid short blocks that
//! fix pre-echo. Per-window perceptual shaping is a later refinement.
